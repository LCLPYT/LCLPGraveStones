# LCLPGraveStones
A simple gravestone plugin for Minecraft Spigot.

## Usage
This plugins spawns a gravestone which contains all the items the player had before his death.<br>
<br>
The gravestone placement system is secure and will search for a suitable place where the gravestone has place.<br>
On death, a message is sent containing the coordinates of the gravestone.
Broken gravestones do not drop chest blocks since the plugin memorizes if a chest is a gravestone.

**Please note**:
Gravestones only spawn in worlds where the game rule "keepInventory" is set to false.
